## Installation
The code must be cloned from the repository.

## Usage
To see route functionality, prepare endpoint calls as shown in the video. The video used Insomnia. Run node index.js to start the app or nodemon index.js to start it with nodemon. Get methods will show existing data. The bodies of the put, post and delete methods can be modified to create custom data. The properties must be the same but the values can be anything, the email property must be in a valid email format when creating a user.

## Testing
